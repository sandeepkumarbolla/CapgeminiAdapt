            Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.

            Color theories create a logical structure for color. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, we can organize them by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.

            "Primary colours" can be mixed to make other colours. Red, green, and blue are the three traditional primary colours. The primary colours for television screens and computer monitors are red, green and blue. Printers and paints use magenta, yellow, and cyan as their primary colours; they may also use black. Sometimes this set of colours is simply called red, yellow, and blue.

            People who can not see colours or have a distorted sense of colour are called colour blind. Most colour blind people are male.
            
            Colours are sometimes added to food. Food colouring is used to colour food, but some foods have natural colourings, like beta carotene.
            
            When something has no colour, it is transparent. An example is air.
            
            The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science.
            
            A translucent material is not the same as a colourless material because it can still have a colour, like stained glass.

      <h2>The fundamentals of understanding color theory</h2>
      <p id="footed">
        Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color; and the visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also involves the messages colors communicate; and the methods used to replicate color.

In color theory, colors are organized on a color wheel and grouped into 3 categories: primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors. More on that later.
